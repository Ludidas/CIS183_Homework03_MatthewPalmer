Full CRUD App that allows an admin to create, read, update, and delete users in a database

From the main screen, a user may be selected to view the info associated with their account.
Upon pressing the "Edit User" button, the admin will be taken to a screen in which they may change the info associated with the account.

When on the main screen, the admin may press the "New User" button to be brought to the "User Registration" page.
Here, the admin may enter all of the information associated with the account.
There is also some light error checking associated with it, including not allowing multiple of the same username and not allowing blank entries.
